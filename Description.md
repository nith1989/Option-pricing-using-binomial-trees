# Option-pricing-using-binomial-trees

Part 1: Given user inputs for current stock prices, stock volatility, risk-free interest rate, strike price, u &amp; d (up &amp; down factors for stocks), size of the time steps, type of option – call/ put (oType), the code computes the value for a European call/ put option.

Part 2: Choosing IBM stocks and the corresponding options maturing before the next dividen paying date, the code calibrates a multi-period 
binomial model. Historical stocks data was used to calibrate volatility (σ), up-down factors (u & d) and risk-neutral probabilities (pTilda).
